# Resume Classification using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to automatically classify resumes into different job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## Objective
- Process unstructured resume text
- Convert text into numerical features
- Build a classification model for resumes

## Dataset
- Resume text data
- Job category labels

## Steps Performed
1. Text Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Tokenization & Stopword Removal
3. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

## Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLP

## Outcome
The model accurately classifies resumes into relevant job categories and can be used in automated recruitment systems.

## Internship
Project completed during AI Internship at AiVariant.
